This project involves the creation of a multi-page Power BI dashboard designed to provide a 360-degree view of a retail business's performance. It transitions from historical descriptive analytics to predictive analytics, allowing stakeholders to understand past trends and anticipate future sales volumes.
This dashboard enables management to:
1.Optimize Inventory: Anticipate demand peaks using the 15-day forecast.
2.Target Marketing: Identify underperforming states (e.g., North Carolina) for localized campaigns.
3.Revenue Recovery: Analyze months with negative profit (e.g., May and July) to identify and mitigate seasonal losses.
